============================================

Before proposing a pull request, please check the following:

* Your code should follow the [PSR-2 coding standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md). But don't worry, if you're code style isn't perfect. [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/) will automatically merge any style fixes into the repository after any pull requests are merged. This allows us to focus on the content of the contribution.
* If you commit a new feature, be prepared to help maintaining it. Watch the project on GitHub, and please comment on issues or PRs regarding the feature you contributed.
* You should create a PHPUnit testcase to make sure that your feature is testable. If you're not familiar with PHPUnit or Unit testing - nevermind. We will help you to create that tests.
* You should build and add a new PHAR file to your pull request. We use [Box](http://box-project.github.io/box2/) to build the PHAR file.
